          <h1>The most community-centered bookstore in Narnia</h1>

          <p>
            “What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door
            was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his
            kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is
            not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances
            every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love,
            though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with
            you at the next ball.”
          </p>

          <p>
            “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I am the
            youngest, I’m the tallest.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
            return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him
            to dinner.
          </p>

          <h2>Now accepting books for consignment!</h2>

          <p>
            “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.
            “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is
            laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What
            say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know,
            and read great books and make extracts.”
          </p>

          <p>Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.</p>

          <p>
            “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to
            Mr. Bingley.”
          </p>

          <p>“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.</p>

          <h2>Our new children's reading area is now open</h2>

            “I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before?
            If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have
            called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the
            visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
            Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of
            joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected
            all the while.
          </p>

          <p>
            “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
            persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
            neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such
            a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never
            said a word about it till now.”
          </p>

          <p>
            “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet;
            and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of
            his wife.
